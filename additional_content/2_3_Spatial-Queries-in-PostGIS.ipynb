    "PostGIS is a free and open source library that adds spatial database functionality to PostgreSQL. It stores spatial data characteristics such as whether data are points (addresses or lat-lon), polygons (areas) or lines (streets). Further, with PostGIS you can query, index, and manipulate spatial data using SQL.\n",
    " \n",
    "Spatial queries are queries involving the spatial dimension of data, which includes location, area, distance and interaction (Anselin 1990). Although they can be univariate (Where is this address?) they often involve relationships between different locations or geometric features. One of the things that differentiates spatial relationships is that what is closer tends to be more related than what is further away (Tobler 1979). There are many ways to operationalize proximity (Church and Murray 2009): One involves distance. Examples include straight-line distance, street-line distance, nearest neighbors or travel time by foot or transit. Alternative operationalizations focus on topological relationships such as adjacency (e.g. shared boundary), contiguity (travel through connected parts), intersection (two geometries meet or overlap) or connectivity (e.g. movement between two locations, often on network). Further, proximity can also be measured in terms of topological transformations such as buffers that transform a point using a distance threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, with spatial queries you can ask about relationships between geometries stored in your spatial database. Examples of such questions can be about access to jobs: “How many employers are within half a mile of a location?” or “Who are the five employers closest to this location?” or summarize characteristics of neighboring locations like “What is the average wage within half a mile of a location? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can answer these questions using different kinds of spatial queries, depending on whether your data are stored as addresses, areas or lines. Different combinations are possible, e.g. querying points in relationship to other points, points related to areas, areas related to areas, lines to areas, etc. Questions to illustrate this include: “How many welfare recipients live within a mile of human services?” (point-to-point with buffer) or “How many low-wage earners live within a mile of each employer?” (point to center of area with buffer) or “For each block, what are the average wages in neighboring blocks?” (area to area).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common spatial query functions that operationalize proximity in postGIS include (geometries can be points, lines or areas):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ST_Distance](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/ST_Distance.html): Distance - distance between two geometries (e.g. two points)\n",
    "* [ST_Within](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/ST_Within.html): Intersection (Overlap) - one geometry is completely inside another (e.g. points in area)\n",
    "* [ST_Intersects](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/ST_Intersects.html): Intersection (Meet) - one geometry shares a portion with another (e.g. parts of line in area)\n",
    "* [ST_Touches](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/ST_Touches.html): Adjacency - geometries share common points but not interior (e.g. neighboring blocks)\n",
    "* [ST_DWithin](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/ST_DWithin.html): Buffer - geometries within specified distance (e.g. points within radius)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial queries involve choices about areas: What is the shape of the micro areas you are analyzing? If you aggregate individual-level data, what is the level of aggregation? These questions are challenging since the choice of area shape and the level of aggregation often yields different results: Two currently debated examples of this are gerrymandering and the masking of the Flint lead problem when analyzed at the zip code level (Sadler 2016) (see Openshaw 1979 and the MAUP problem for more background). If you start with addresses you have a choice about boundaries and levels of aggregation. With blocks, you can examine the impact of different levels of aggregation, albeit without control over the shape of the aggregated areas. In other cases, you will have less control over either -- e.g. when all you can access for confidentiality reasons is zip code data.\n",
    " \n",
    "Spatial indexing is used to speed up spatial queries for large datasets by indexing generalizations (bounding boxes) of geometric features rather than the features themselves. (You can add a spatial index with the **USING GIST** command, which stands for generic index structure.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples of postGIS spatial queries illustrate some of these possibilities for relating points to points, points to areas, and areas to areas."

    "\n",
    "There are several things you need to take care of under the hood before you can run spatial queries. Two important issues are geocoding and projections. Geocoding matches an address to a point on a map. This matching requires a reference map that a given address or address component can be compared to using an address locator. The quality of the input address data, reference map (also referred to as Master Address File) and address locator influence the precision of the match, indicated by a score. Popular and accurate address geocoding APIs are Google Maps’ (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) but this service limits the number of records you can geocode per gmail account. It is also an online service, which does not work for restricted data that has to be stores offline. A popular offline geocoding solution that integrates with postgreSQL/postGIS is MapZen’s Pelias service: https://mapzen.com/blog/pelias-setup-tutorial/. For more information about geocoding, see Geocoding in PostGIS (http://postgis.net/docs/Extras.html) and http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/three-standard-geocoding-methods/123627. "

    "\n",
    "The geocoded point on a map has an X and Y coordinate. The unit of these coordinates is in degrees. These degrees need to be projected to obtain commonly used metrics such as feet or meters that are needed for spatial queries involving distances. Projections convert a spherical to a flat surface. There are lots of projection choices to do this that involve different trade-offs in accuracy between distance, direction, form, and area. If you are combining multiple spatial datasets (such as points and areas), they need to share the same projection to overlay correctly on the same map. For more information about projections, see http://www.axismaps.com/guide/projections/ and https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/understanding-projections-with-spatial-and-geo-data. \n",
